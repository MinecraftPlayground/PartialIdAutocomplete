# Partial ID Autocomplete Minecraft Mod

This Minecraft Fabric mod extends the autocompletion for id arguments in commands
for completing ids only up to a certain segment.

For example, if you have many functions under `namespace:folder_name/`, you can now
complete only the `namespace:folder_name/` part instead of having to directly complete the
full function id.
